Hi, I'm Labiyb!

I am a final-year PhD student in Mechanical Systems Engineering at Tokyo Metropolitan University, advised by Professor Naoyuki Takesue. My research focuses on developing autonomous ornithopters that mimic bird flight capabilities. Currently, I serve as a Research Assistant while also working as a part-time robotics engineer at QibiTech Inc., where I contribute to industrial robotics solutions.
My journey in robotics began at Electronic Engineering Polytechnic Institute of Surabaya, where I earned my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering (2018). During this time, I developed strong foundations in embedded systems and robotics through competitive robotics, winning the Indonesian Robocon 2016 and achieving 2nd Runner-up at ABU Robocon 2016. My undergraduate work focused on navigation algorithms for omnidirectional mobile robots.

I completed my Master's in Mechanical Systems Engineering at Tokyo Metropolitan University (2021), where I developed flapping robots with tail control systems. Recent achievements include securing 3rd place in the Customer Interaction Task at World Robot Summit @IFAC 2023, where I led the programming team for autonomous service robot implementation.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've developed experience in building complete robotic solutions from scratch - from mechanical design to system integration. I focus on embedded systems development, sensor integration, and autonomous navigation implementation utilizing both ROS and native approaches.

I am passionate about creating innovative robotic solutions that can make meaningful contributions to society, particularly in the field of autonomous systems.
