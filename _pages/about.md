Hi, I am Labiyb!

I am a final-year PhD student at Department of Mechanical Systems Engineering of Tokyo Metropolitan University, advised by Professor Naoyuki Takesue. My research interest is developing and enhancing capability of an ornithopter mimicking a real bird. Currently, I am AR research fellow. Currently, I am working as a part-time robotics engineer at QibiTech, Inc. During my PhD, I participated and got the 3rd place on World Robot Summit @IFAC 2023 on Customer Interacton Task using a service robot. 

In 2018, I graduated from Electronic Engineering Polytechnic Institute of Surabaya/Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya with Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering. During my bachelor, I participated on some competitions to shape my skills in robotics. I won Indonesian Robocon 2016 and 2nd Runner-up on ABU Robocon 2016. My undergraduate thesis is navigation on omnidirectional mobile robot implemented on a soccer robot.

In 2021, I graduated from Tokyo Metropolitan University with Master of Engineering in Mechanical Systems Engineering. In the begining of master course, I joined World Robot Summit Trial Competition 2019 in Tokyo, Japan. My master thesis is investigation and development of a flapping robot with tail control. 

I want to utilize expertise in Embedded Systems, Robotics, and Mechatronics to create innovative and impactful
solution for society.
