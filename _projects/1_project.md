This project develops an
ornithopter that can be a helpful robot for future in the society. This project is a part of my academic path from
master student to PhD student(now).

• I built my robot from scratch. I designed and manufactured the mechanism and electrical circuit board. I also
built the embedded system and GUI/visualization.
• The previous version robot used ROS 1 as the data distribution system framework. A Wireless connectivity
was chosen to enable long-distance control. A Raspberry Pi-Zero was used to handle the communication with
the base station and low-level controller . An Arduino Nano 33 BLE which is a low-level controller was used to
support the system and control the attitude of robot by using PID controller. Those master and slave hardware
are connected via serial communication.
• The current version uses ROS2. A teensy 4.1 which is a powerful ARM microcontroller was used to support the
data acquisition. The collected data from teensy is sent to the PC using created serial communication protocol
in a low-latency. There is a node to handle the data to be integrated with another ROS2 sub-system or IPC
through shared-memory.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
