This project aims to handle some problems that can
happen at the convenience store such as a large queue size and object returned to its shelf. This project is a part of
WRS competition held during IFAC2023. A Seed R7 which is a service mobile robot platform is used to handle the
tasks. In our system, we were trying to offer self-payment and returning the cancelled products. A kinect camera
is mounted to estimate the grasping position and type of the object that will be returned to its shelf. To monitor
the queue, another camera is also placed on the environment. A lidar is also mounted to the robot for simultaneous
localization and mapping(SLAM). It is used for robot to navigate to the desired position and avoid the obstacle. The
data distribution is handled by using ROS
