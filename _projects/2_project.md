In this project, I and my team were trying to build mobile robot to handle or to solve the
tasks. We built 2 autonomous robot with different size, the small robot could not move by itself and has only a
steering mechanism. Several iteration of robot development from scratch were done.The bigger robot has to drive the
small robot without making contact. After the robot is succeeded to drive the small robot, the bigger robot should
pick the propeller that is mounted on small robot, climb a pole, and place the propeller on the pole.

<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.html path="assets/img/hybrid.jpeg" title="A hybrid robot" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>

That figure shows the robot that I worked on.
