This project worked with an unmanned water vehicle
to complete a task. I became the head of this project to manage or to organize the team working as the desired. It
participated in Unmanned Surface Vehicle(USV) Contest 2016. We built catamaran and monohull boats using balsa
wood. The USVs navigate autonomously using a feedback information from a camera. It used a basic concept of
computer vision to detect the color and calculate theta of colored balls. There are color-coded balls arranged on the
edges of the path. These balls serve as boundary markers for autonomous navigation using cameras. By using the
visual servoing, the robot can navigate to stay on the track.

Contribution:
1. Lead programmer and team. 
2. Integrate and optimize embedded system and computer vision.
3. Develop vehicle's structure.

Skills: C, C++, Computer Vision (OpenCV).
